Question 7. Explain call(),apply() and bind() methods.
-> call() method allows an object to use the method (function) of another object.
-> call() method takes arguments separately whereas,apply() method takes arguments as an array.
-> This method returns a new function, where the value of "this" keyword will be bound to the owner object,which is provided as a parameter.

Question 8.What is currying in JavaScript?
-> Currying is an advanced technique to transform a function of arguments n,to n functions of one or less arguments.

Example:
function add(a){
    return function(b){
        return a + b;
    }
}

add(3)(4)

Question 9. Explain Scope and Scope Chain in JavaScript.
-> Scope in JS, determines the accessbility of variables and functions at various parts in one's code.

In general terms, the scope will let us know at a given part of code what are the variable and functions that we can or cannot access.

There are three types of scopes in JS:
Global Scope
Local or Function Scope
Block Scope

Question 10. Explain Closures in JavaScript.
-> Closures is an ability of a function to remember the variables and functions that are declared in its outer scope.

Example:
function randomFunc(){
    var obj1 = { name: "Sumit", age: 20};

    return function(){
        console.log(obj1.name + " is " + " awesome"); //Has access to obj1 even when the randomFunc function is executed
    }
}

var initialiseClosure = randomFunc(); //Returns a function
initialiseClosure();
