Question 21. What are classes in JavaScript?
-> Introduced in the ES6 version, classes are nothing but syntactic sugars for constructor functions.

They provide a new way of declaring constructor functions in javascript.

class Student{
    constructor(name,rollName,grade,section){
        this.name = name;
    }
    getDetails(){
        return 'Name: ${this.name};
    }
}


Question 22. Explain WeakSet in JavaScript.
-> In javaScript, Set is a collection of unique and oreder elements.

Just like Set, WeakSet is also a collection of unique and oredered elements with some key differences:

▶️ Weakset contains only objects and no other type.
▶️ An object inside the weakset is referenced weakly. This means, if the object inside the weakset does no have a reference, it will be garbage collected.
▶️ Unlike Set, WeakSet only has three methods, add() , delete() and has()

Question 23. Explain WeakMap in JavaScript.
-> In javascript, Map is used to store key-value pairs. The key-value pairs can be of both primitive and non-primitive types.

WeakMap is similar to Map with key differences:

▶️ The keys and values in weakmap should always be an object.
▶️ If there are no references to the object, the object will be garbage collected.

Question 24. What is Object Destructuring?
-> Object destructuring is a new way to extact elements from an object or an array.

Example:
const classDetails={
    strength: 78,
    benches: 39,
    blackBoard:1
}

const { strength: classStrength, benches: classBenches blackBoard: classBlackBoard} = classDetails;

console.log(classStrength); //outputs: 78
console.log(classBenches); //outputs: 39
console.log(classBlackBoard); //outputs: 1

Question 25. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?
-> Temporal Dead Zone is a behaviour that occurs with variables declared using let and const keywords.

It is a behaviour where we try to access a variable before it is initialized.

Example:
x = 23; // Gives reference error
let x;
