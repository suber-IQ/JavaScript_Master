Question 18. What is the rest parameter?
-> Rest parameter (...);
Using the rest parameter syntax, we can create functions that can take a variable number of arguments.

Example:
function extractingArgs(...args){
    return args[1];
}

Question 19. What is the spread operator?
-> Spread parameter(...);
spread operator is used to spread an array, and object literals.

Example:
function addFourNumbers(num1,num2,num3,num4){
    return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
}

let fourNumbers = [5,6,7,8];

addFourNumbers(..fourNumbers);

Question 20. What is use of promises in javaScript?
-> Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in javaScript.
Before promises,callbacks were used to handle asynchronous operations. But due to limited functionality of callback, using multiple callbacks to handle asynchronous code can lead to unmanageable code.

-> A promise is created using the Promise constructor which takes in a callback function with two parameters,resovle and reject respectively.
▶️ resolve is a function that will be called,when the async operation has been successfully completed.
▶️ reject is a function that will be called,when the async operation fails or if some error occurs.
