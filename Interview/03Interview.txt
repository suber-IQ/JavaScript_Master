Question 11. What are object prototypes?
-> All javaScript objects inherit properties from a prototype.

For example,
Date objects inherit properties from the Date prototype
Math objects inherit properties from the Math prototype

A prototype is a blueprint of an object. Prototype allows us to use properties and methods on an object even if the properties and methods do not exist on the current object.

Question 12. What are callbacks?
-> A callback is a function that will be executed after function gets executed.

In javaScript, functions are treated as first-class citizens,they can be used as an argument of another function,can be returned by another function and can be used as a property of an object.

Function that are used as an argument to another function are called callback functions.


Question 13. What is recursion in a programming language?
-> Recursion in a technique to iterate over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result.

Example:
function add(number){
    if(number <= 0){
        return 0;
    }else{
        return number + add(number - 1);
    }
}

add(3);

Question 14. What is the use of a constructor function in javaScript?
-> Constructor functions are used to objects in javascript.

Example:
function Person(name,age,gender){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
}

var person1 = new Person("Sumit",20,"male");
console.log(person1);

Question 15. What is Dom?
-> Dom stands for Document Object Model.

DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.

When the browser tries to render a HTML document,it creates and object based on the HTML document called DOM. Using this DOM,we can manipulate or Change various elements inside the HTML document.

Question 16. What are arrow functions?
-> Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javaScript.They provide us with a new and shorter syntax for declaring functions.Arrow functions can only be used as a function expression.

//Traditional Function expression
var add = function(a,b){
    return a + b;
}

// Arrow Function expression
var arrowAdd = (a,b) => a + b;

Question 17. Difference between declaring variable using var,let and const
-> Variables that are declared with the var keyword in the global scope are added to the window/global object.Therefore, they can be accessed using
window.variableName.
-> Variable declared with let keyword inside the block scope cannot be accessed from outside of the block.
-> Variables with the const keyword behave exactly like a variable declared with the let keyword with only one difference, any variable declared with the const keyword cannot be reassigned.
